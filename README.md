App uses unsplashed API to search for images based on user input. 

Project demonstrates use of:

-child to parent communication of components (passed a callback from App component(parent) to Searchbar component (child), then Searchbar  called callback)

-managing network requests using axios library (making requests to unsplash API)  

-rendering a list using map function (list of images on app)

-React refs (ImageCard component used ref to dynamically alter image span) 

-Grid CSS (styling of image list as grid based system)
